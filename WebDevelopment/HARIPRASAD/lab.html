<h2><b><i>What is object-oriented Programming Language?</i></b></h2>
<p>
<b><i>Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language</i></b>, which means in Java everything is written in terms of <b><i>classes and objects</i></b>. Now, what is an Object? The object is nothing but a real-world entity that can represent any person, place, or thing and can be distinguished from others. Every object near us has some state and behaviour associated with it.
